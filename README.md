# DOM-Manipulation 
The above JavaScript code is a simple implementation of a shopping list where the user can add and remove items from the list. The code uses DOM manipulation to add new items to the list and also a delete button to remove individual items from the list.

In addition to that, the code also adds a "Delete All" button dynamically to the HTML page only when there are more than one items in the list. The button allows the user to remove all items from the list at once. This feature enhances the user experience by saving time and effort in case the list has a lot of items.

The code also listens for the "Enter" key on the keyboard to add an item to the list, in addition to the click event on the "Add" button. Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to manage a shopping list.
